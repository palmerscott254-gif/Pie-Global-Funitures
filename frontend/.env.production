# Vite Frontend Environment Variables - Production/Vercel Deployment
# Note: Only variables prefixed with VITE_ are exposed to the client
# IMPORTANT: These values can be overridden by Vercel Environment Variables
# Set VITE_API_URL in Vercel Project Settings > Environment Variables

# API Configuration 
# Production: Point to deployed backend (Render)
# Backend now sends ABSOLUTE URLs for all media, so frontend just needs the API endpoint
VITE_API_URL=https://pie-global-funitures.onrender.com/api/

# Production marker for debugging
VITE_ENV=production

# NOTE: VITE_S3_BASE_URL is NO LONGER NEEDED
# The backend now returns absolute media URLs (S3 or backend-served)
# The frontend trusts these URLs and doesn't need to reconstruct them
